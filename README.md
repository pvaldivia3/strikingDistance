The Striking Distance Report, a FourFront LLC product, is a product that I built in Plotly Dash.  It analyzes Search Engine Optimization data across a domain (which can be selected for).

Some of the data includes the the Keyword (which we use interchangeably here with query), the URL, the search volume, the average position (AvgPos), the number of impressions and clicks that page received over the last month, and groups the average position into a ranking group.  It also displays the visibility share, which is a custom metric representing a ratio of clicks to search volume for each keyword (or, query) and url.

According to Enge, Spencer, and Stricchiola, "Optimizing pages that are in Striking Distance is often the fastest way to increase traffic (and revenue) from your SEO efforts.

Here is a picture of the tool, albeit with some confidential information removed.  Note that impressions to search volume may be quite low for keywords even with a high average position, because position is only collected when the URL appears in the Search Engine Results Page.
